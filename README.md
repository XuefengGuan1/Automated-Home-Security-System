# Automated-Home-Security-System

## Project Purpose
Living in San Francisco can be dangerous sometimes, thus, I put my thoughts on creating a home security system that can best prevent home break-ins.

This home security system has several functionalities:
  1. Has a 1MP watching the front-door, redirect the view to phones to make sure the identity of the person knocking on the door.
  2. Uses a sensor to detect movements inside of the house when host is not home. When movements detected, will send an alert to the host's phone.
  3. Monitor if windows are opened when host is not home. Will immedietely triggers an alarm when windows are opened, alarm can be muffled on the phone app.
